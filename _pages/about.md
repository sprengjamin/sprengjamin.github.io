I’m Benjamin Spreng — a physicist and scientific software developer specializing in theoretical and numerical modeling of quantum systems.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Davis, working with [Jeremy N. Munday](https://mundaylab.com/). I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Augsburg in Germany under the supervision of [Gert-Ludwig Ingold](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/mntf/physik/groups/theo1/arbeitsgruppe/ingold/).

My research combines physics and computation, focusing on the development of high-performance Python software for large-scale quantum simulations, often in collaboration with experimental groups.
